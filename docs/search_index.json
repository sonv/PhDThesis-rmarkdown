Almost everyone in the United States has either an air-conditioner or a heater; nuclear plants and data centers need sophisticated heat transfer systems to stay cool. 1.2 Mathematical background The main tools for our analysis come from probability. In this section, I will re-call some standard facts that are essential to our understanding of the problem.
